    "\n",
    "In a sense, we have now created an abstraction tower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term monad refers to a very generic pattern about objects whose methods return monadic objects so that method calls can be chained, together with a generic way with which the application of those methods can be influenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this general pattern, we can define more specific patterns that use the general pattern for more specific purposes. The Maybe Monad is one example of this, but there are many others. These are still patterns, not concrete, useful classes, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then can take this monadic pattern and create a specific class which implements this pattern and finally have something useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monads are meta patterns for specific monadic structures, which are patterns for actually useful classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like with other design patterns, the important part is not that you create the full abstraction tower in your code, it’s that you use the pattern. A class that implements a singleton is still a singleton, even if it does not inherit from a singleton abstract class. A factory method is still a factory method, even if it does not implement an abstract factory method interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially true for dynamically-typed languages, and probably the greatest source of confusion for people coming from the statically typed world. Python objects do not need a rigid type hierarchy and type checks to implement patterns that require careful consideration for the type system in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first implementation we used here is still monadic, even though we did not make bind explicit. It’s useful to see that there is a common pattern there, but it’s not necessary to actually make this pattern explicit in your code. If you have your software engineer hat on, your goal is to create programs that solve problems, and this is the most important thing you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you are wearing your computer scientist hat, your focus is on analyzing the patterns in programs first, and solving real-world problems only second. This is where it becomes important to split up those patterns, to make sure you know exactly what you are talking about and how the different concepts interact."

    "## State Monad\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s add some complexity. The state monad is a design pattern where you use method chaining to create a computation. The resulting computation then can be run against various inputs (initial states). This is a very handy pattern for all sorts of tasks, like creating a pattern matcher from a pattern specification or pre-computing a composable sequence of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that we define methods in our monad instances that add computations. At the end, we call the accumulated function with an initial state. That state then is passed through the accumulated computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is a simple game (courtesy of haskell.org). This game is played in moves. Each move is either an a, a b, or a c. If the game is on, an a will add one point and b will deduce one point. If the game is off, neither one does anything. A c will toggle the game between on and off. The game starts in the off state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> start_state = (False, 0)\n",
    ">>> Game().move('a').move('b').run(start_state)\n",
    "(False, 0)\n",
    ">>> game = Game().move('c').move('a')\n",
    ">>> game.run(start_state)\n",
    "(True, 1)\n",
    ">>> game.move('b').move('c').move('a').run(start_state)\n",
    "(False, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
